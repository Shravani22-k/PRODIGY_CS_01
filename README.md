🔒 Caesar Cipher
This project implements a Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption tool using Python and Tkinter for the GUI. The development was done using the PyCharm IDE.

📖 Overview
The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. This tool allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher technique.

📚 Theoretical Concept
The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, 'A' would be replaced by 'B', 'B' would become 'C', and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

📂 Code Overview
File: caesar_cipher.py
This file contains the main implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption tool using a Tkinter GUI.

Imports
python import tkinter as tk from tkinter import messagebox

Functions
encrypt_caesar(text, shift): Encrypts the text using the Caesar Cipher technique.
decrypt_caesar(encrypted_text, shift): Decrypts the text using the Caesar Cipher technique.
encrypt_message(): Handles the encryption button click event.
decrypt_message(): Handles the decryption button click event.
clear(): Clears all input and output fields.
GUI Setup
root: Tkinter main application window.
entry_message: Input field for the message to be encrypted or decrypted.
entry_shift_encrypt: Input field for the encryption shift value.
entry_shift_decrypt: Input field for the decryption shift value.
label_encrypted: Label to display the encrypted message.
label_decrypted: Label to display the decrypted message.
button_encrypt: Button to trigger the encryption process.
button_decrypt: Button to trigger the decryption process.
button_clear: Button to clear all fields.
Example Usage
Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt in the provided input field.
Enter the shift value (a number) for the Caesar Cipher.
Select whether you want to encrypt or decrypt the text by clicking the respective button.
The result will be displayed on the screen.
