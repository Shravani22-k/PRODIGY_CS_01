Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption
Overview
This project implements the Caesar Cipher, a simple and well-known encryption technique used in cryptography. The Caesar Cipher works by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on.

Features
Encryption: Convert plain text into ciphertext using a specified shift.
Decryption: Convert ciphertext back into plain text using the same shift.
Customizable Shift: Users can specify the number of positions to shift.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

Installation
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/caesar-cipher.git

Navigate into the project directory: cd caesar-cipher

Usage
You can use the provided functions to encrypt and decrypt text.

Functions
encrypt(plain_text: str, shift: int) -> str: Encrypts the input text using the given shift.
decrypt(cipher_text: str, shift: int) -> str: Decrypts the input text using the given shift.
